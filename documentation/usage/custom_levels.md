# Making Custom Levels

:::caution
This tooling is in very early stages.
:::

TODO:
- Document the manual steps outlined in the custom levels readme
- Explain the use of `game.gp` and `level-info.gc`
- Document working actor types and their code snippets to be added to levels
- Document loading boundary edits
- Document progress menu edits
- List of Game task numbers?
- Document exporting glb from blender (which settings can be exported)
- Document the use of the level editor? (maybe wait for it to be more stable)
